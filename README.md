## Problem Statement
The longest Zig-Zag subsequence problem is to find length of the longest
subsequence of given sequence such that all elements of this are
alternating.
If a sequence {x1, x2, .. xn} is alternating sequence then its element satisfy
one of the following relation :
 x1 < x2 > x3 < x4 > x5 < …. xn or
 x1 > x2 < x3 > x4 < x5 > …. xn
Solve using Dynamic programming.

## Theory
Let’s first formally define what subsequence is.
A  subsequence  is  a  sequence  that  can  be  derived  from  an-other  sequence  by  zero  or  more  elements,  without  changingthe  order  of  the  remaining  elements  as  an  example  for  thearray[1,2,3,4]the  subsequences  are  (1),  (2),  (3),  (4),  (1,2),(1,3),(1,4),  (2,3),  (2,4),  (3,4),  (1,2,3),  (1,2,4),  (1,3,4),  (2,3,4),(1,2,3,4)
