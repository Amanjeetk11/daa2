## Problem Statement
The longest Zig-Zag subsequence problem is to find length of the longest
subsequence of given sequence such that all elements of this are
alternating.
If a sequence {x1, x2, .. xn} is alternating sequence then its element satisfy
one of the following relation :
 x1 < x2 > x3 < x4 > x5 < …. xn or
 x1 > x2 < x3 > x4 < x5 > …. xn
Solve using Dynamic programming.
