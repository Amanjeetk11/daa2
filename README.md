## Problem Statement
The longest Zig-Zag subsequence problem is to find length of the longest
subsequence of given sequence such that all elements of this are
alternating.
If a sequence {x1, x2, .. xn} is alternating sequence then its element satisfy
one of the following relation :
 x1 < x2 > x3 < x4 > x5 < …. xn or
 x1 > x2 < x3 > x4 < x5 > …. xn
Solve using Dynamic programming.


## How to use code
Download project
git clone https://github.com/Amanjeetk11/daa2.git 
Project Initialize 
```
cd daa
mkdir daa2

#go to daa2
cd daa2

#Create file
touch readme.md
touch code1.cpp
touch code2.cpp
.
.
```
---

Run the code
```
g++ code_1.cpp -o code_1
g++ code_2.cpp -o code_2
./code_1
./code_2
```
Output
```
Length of the longest sub sequence of given sequence such that all elements of this are alternating.

### Theory
Let’s first formally define what subsequence is.
A  subsequence  is  a  sequence  that  can  be  derived  from  an-other  sequence  by  zero  or  more  elements,  without  changingthe  order  of  the  remaining  elements  as  an  example  for  thearray[1,2,3,4]the  subsequences  are  (1),  (2),  (3),  (4),  (1,2),(1,3),(1,4),  (2,3),  (2,4),  (3,4),  (1,2,3),  (1,2,4),  (1,3,4),  (2,3,4),(1,2,3,4)

### Analysis

**Time Complexity**

<br />Approach 1:
The time complexity will beO(2^n)because it checks out allthe possibilities by recursing.

<br />Approach 2:
The time complexity will beO(n∗3)because we are in away doing memoization our approach 1 code and saving time by using values of the precalculated subproblems.


**Space Complexity**

<br />Approach 1:
<br />The space complexity isO(n),for storing the input array.

<br />Approach 2:
<br />The space complexity will beO(n)for input array andO(n∗3)for storing the values of each condition by dynamic programming.


---

### Conclusion

<br />Above two methods have different time complexity & space complexity and meet to fulfill the problem statement. The order in which they are good can be listed as:
<br />I. Approach 2
<br />II. Approach 1
<br />Based on the time complexity and space complexity.
